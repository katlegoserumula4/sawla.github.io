     <p style="padding: 30px;text-align: center;">In Kimberley at the Gala dinner members and guests made pledges but it is sad that some of our members removed their names from the list. <br> 
 
     In Cape Town at the AGM members of SAWLA pledged particularly those that were acting Judges. The members that have paid their pledges thus far are Nomahlubi Khwinana, Khensani Moila, Nthabiseng Serabele, and Lilly Malatsi-Tefo. <br>

     Saul pledged a sum of R250 000.00 (two hundred and fifty thousand rands) to the  SAWLA DF. The said funds will be paid in three parts, the first amount of R100 000.00 having been paid now on the 13th September 2022.  <br>
 
     We await further payment of another R100 000.00 from the Premier then the last payment of R50 000.00 in the year of 2024. <br>
 
     During the gala dinner, those that attended the event being members and friends of SAWLA made pledges. A list of all members that have to-date paid will be availed. The money was being fundraised to assist in taking the National Executive of the Student Chapter to Cape Town.

     <p style="padding: 30px;text-align: center;">There are projects that have been earmarked by Programs Committee which entails: GBVF and Mental Wellness. It is a fact that our members are not immune from GBV and Mental Wellness hence these programs. 
 
     The other focus area is to fund PMT as we have taken stock and noted that young practitioners are unable to pay for the course which compromises their fidelity fund certificate. SAWLADF through SAWLA has signed an MOU with SASSETA and what is left is to see candidate program being rolled out where our members will have candidate attorneys being paid a stipend through SASSETA. It is the duty of the committee to ensure that all candidate attorneys that will serve under members of SAWLA are properly trained.

     <p style="padding: 30px;text-align: center;">This committee is headed by Nomaswazi Shabangu-Mndawe. The trustees took a resolution that two beneficiaries be identified to be awarded a bursary. The trustees developed the criteria, and an advert was sent out. It was resolved that R10 000.00 will be awarded to each successful candidate which funds were to be paid directly to the institution. 
 
    The Trustees proceeded to set-up a bursary selection committee which included Mapula Keetse and Petunia Thulare. The said committee assessed the applications and the following candidates were successful: <br>
    <strong>Beneficiaries</strong> <br>
    1.  Khethukuthula Mthombeni - UWC  <br>
    2.  Nthabeleng Mokoena - UNISA <br>

    The trustees with the bursary committee deliberated on how the committee should be proceeded with. It was resolved that the Bursary Committee no longer be regarded as a committee but be independent body as the funders requiring an independent bank account. The bursary committee was then registered as a Bursary 
    Fund Non-Profit Company (NPC) in September 2022 the directors thereof being Mapula Keetse (Chairperson), Petunia Thulare (Secretary) and Nomaswazi Shabangu-Mndawe (Treasurer).

There are brochures that have been developed that explain what the fund provides. Banners of the organisation have been developed and are always being used at events of SAWLA in order to ensure visibility and that people are in the know as to what SAWLA Development Fund  
 
 
     entails. Our Marketing initiatives are minimal and have historically been with a bias towards marketing material for events and mainly our AGM. 
 
     The Chairperson of the committee resigned in order to further her studies. The provinces that are not represented in the fund have been approached to provide a person that will be part of the fund and we have since received names and are in the necessary process with the Master of the High Court.
